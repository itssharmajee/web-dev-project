The Amazon Clone is a web-based project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to replicate Amazon’s interface. It includes essential pages such as Login, Registration, Home, Product Card, and Description Page, providing a hands-on learning experience in frontend development.
It visually replicates Amazon’s interface but does not include backend functionality.

Login Page: A static sign-in interface with input fields for email/phone.
Registration Page: A simple form layout for new user sign-ups.
Home Page: Displays product categories, banners, and a grid-based product listing.
Product Card Page: Showcases individual product details, including images and pricing.
Description Page: Provides a static product description layout with specifications.
This project is purely a UI/UX representation without working functionalities like authentication or cart management
